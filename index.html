    <h3>A popular tourist site in Bangladesh with
        unique photo opportunities.</h3>
    <p>Jaflong is a popular destination in Bangladesh among the local tourists. It is located in the north-eastern part of Bangladesh <br>
        on the India-Bangladesh border. People come here mainly on a day tour from Sylhet, which is the nearest big city.
        <br>
        <br>
        The main attractions to the local tourists are the beautiful hills of the Meghalaya state of
        India. <br>People look toward the stunning view of the hills of Meghalaya while standing on
        the land of Bangladesh. But for the foreign tourists, <br>the attraction of Jaflong is somewhere
        else.
        <br>
        <br>
        Dozens of waterfalls on the hills of Meghalaya create a beautiful river called Piain, which
        flows directly to Bangladesh. <br>This river brings lots of stones from the hills to Bangladesh.
        Hundreds of people in Bangladesh collect these stones <br>from the river Piain every day and
        make it full of activities, which is highly photogenic. The scale of the activities is mindblowing, <br>which brings all the foreign tourists here.
        <br><br>
        These stones are taken to the crushers and later supplied all over Bangladesh as
        construction materials.</p>
